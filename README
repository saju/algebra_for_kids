A simple program to generate linear eqns of the form Ax + B = C.

My kids love maths and it is hard to spontaneously come up with linear equations for them to solve.
I use this program to generate sets of linear equations that I can printout and give to me kids to
keep them productively busy :)

Usage:

$ python3 ax_plus_b_eq_c.py > out.txt
$ cat out.txt | grep -v answer > questions.txt
... printout questions.txt ....

Making the equations "harder"....

$ python3 ax_plus_b_eq_c.py --minA -20 --maxA 30

Will generate linear equations where "A" (the coefficient of x) can take values [-20, 30]. You can
similarily tweak "x" with --minX/--maxX and B with --minB/--maxB.

On the other hand, if you want to remove B completely, set "--minB 0 --maxB 0"
